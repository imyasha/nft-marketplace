## Task Description 
You're tasked with implementing a feature that displays a list of NFTs ( Non-Fungible Tokens) of a given address. 
## Requirements 
1. The list of NFTs should be displayed as a grid of cards, with each card displaying the NFT's details. 
2. When a user clicks on a card, a modal should be displayed that shows more details about the NFT, such as its description and the owner's address. 
3. The modal should have a button that allows the user to purchase the NFT. Clicking the button should navigate them to the relevant OpenSea page. 
4. The design of the grid of cards and the modal is up to you, but it should be visually appealing and easy to use.
